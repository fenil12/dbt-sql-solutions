# üèóÔ∏è E-Commerce Analytics Data Warehouse (dbt Project)

This repository contains a **dbt project** that implements a **Kimball-style dimensional data warehouse** for **e-commerce analytics**.  
The project transforms raw operational and external data into a structured star schema to support **business intelligence**, **reporting**, and **advanced analytics**.

|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Kafka Stream         | Real-time customer interaction events     | `kafka_stream`         |
| Product Data         | Product master and category information   | `product`, `product_category` |
| Sales Data           | Transactional sales records               | `sales_fact`           |
| Customer Data        | Customer master data                      | `customer`             |
| Subscription Data    | Customer subscription information         | `subscription_data`    |

## üß± Model Layers

### 1. **Staging Layer**
**Purpose:**  
Extract, clean, and standardize raw data from all source systems.

**Key Models:**  
`stg_kafka_stream`, `stg_products`, `stg_product_categories`, `stg_sales_fact`, `stg_customer`, `stg_subscriptions`, `stg_weather_data`

**Key Transformations:**
- Data type standardization  
- Null value handling  
- Basic data quality checks  
- Field renaming for consistency  

---

### 2. **Core Dimensional Model**
**Purpose:**  
Implements a **Kimball star schema** for analytical efficiency and consistency.

**Dimension Tables:**
- `dim_products` ‚Äì Product dimension with inventory details  
- `dim_customer` ‚Äì Customer dimension (SCD Type 2)  
- `dim_date` ‚Äì Time-based analytical dimension  

**Fact Tables:**
- `fact_sales` ‚Äì Sales transactions with revenue and quantity metrics  

---

### 3. **Business Marts**
**Purpose:**  
Business-domain focused models designed for stakeholder analysis.

**Financial Analytics**
- `product_category_revenue_monthly`  
- `product_revenue_payment_analysis`  
- `payment_method_preference`  
- `daily_revenue`  

**Customer Analytics**
- `customer_segments` ‚Äì Tier classification, lifetime value, order frequency  

**Operational Analytics**
- `order_for_reviews` ‚Äì Quality checks and business rule violations  

**Seasonal & Trend Analysis**
- `seasonal_sales_analysis` ‚Äì Growth rate and volatility tracking
